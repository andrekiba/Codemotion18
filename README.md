# Codemotion Rome 2018
## Go reactive with Realm and Xamarin Forms

Yet another task app, built with Ream and Xamarin.Forms and cleary inspired by realm.tasks [realm-tasks](http://github.com/realm/realm-tasks)  
and the super beautiful [Realmac Software's Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear) :-)  
Used to show Realm's real-time capabilities during the demo.
Thank you to @nirinchev and @bigfish24 for their kindness.
